# leagify blog

This is the source code (using the [Hugo Static Site Templating engine](https://gohugo.io/)) for the [Leagify github pages site](https://leagify.github.io/).

The code is split into two repositories. The source code is here, and the public-facing code is on the [organization github page](https://github.com/Leagify/leagify.github.io).

This follows the example listed in the Hugo docs here: https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#host-github-user-or-organization-pages


The purpose is to provide more information about what Leagify is, and how people can participate in it.
